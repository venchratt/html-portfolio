<h1>Alex's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h2>The Matrix</h2>
<p>I'm not usually a sci-fi fan but the matrix was really well done and very much a cultural commentary about technology consuming our lives</p>

<h2>Rocky</h2>
<p>I love this feel good story that makes you root for the clear underdog, all you want to see is the main character succeed at his goals</p>

<h2>Black Hawk Down</h2>
<p>A movie about heroism and courage against all odds</p>
